#2-Way BWT search

Forked from [mpetri/FM-Index](https://github.com/mpetri/FM-Index). Done as a student project.

Adds a fast way to search in a compressed text up to 2 errors. Implemented accroding to this article:[ High Throughput Short Read Alignment via Bi-directional BWT.](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dekelts/tsds14/Lam.pdf). Also some random bugs.

Code isn't pretty :(
